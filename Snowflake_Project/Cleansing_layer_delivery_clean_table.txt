--outer => True: This parameter is specific to certain SQL dialects (such as Snowflake). When outer is set to True, it ensures that all rows from the left table (or the table before the lateral flatten operation) are preserved, even if there are no corresponding values in the flattened data. This means that if there are no values in d.value:extras, the output will still contain a row with NULL values for the flattened columns.
